#
# The main difference in the way i impliment these bindings is i want to immediately
# exit the modal selector once an action has been completed. 
#
# The following configuration heavily leverages modal keymaps to minimize the
# pollution of global keybindings. In addition, the modal keymaps facilitate
# the consistent use of the same keybindings across different modes. For
# example, this configuration uses 'h', 'l', 'j', and 'k' to represent west,
# east, south, and north when: changing focus, warping windows, resizing
# windows, swapping windows, and moving floating windows. Those four keys are
# mapped differently depending on the current mode to provide a consistent user
# experience.
# 
# Six different modes are provided in this configuration in addition to the
# default mode. The modes are tailored to their respective operations. Common
# operations are generally available without the need of any modifier keys.
# When modifier keys are used, they are for infrequent actions or size related
# actions. Entry into the modal system is via Ctrl - e, which enters FOCUS
# mode. From there, any of the other modes can be activated with a single
# keypress.
#
#
# The following is a high-level summary of the keybindngs:
#
# GLOBAL KEYBINDINGS:

#                    cmd - return    Open a floating Hyper 
#
